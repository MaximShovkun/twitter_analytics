# Twitter API Testing Repository

### Want to play with these notebooks without having to install anything?
Use any of the following services.

**WARNING**: Please be aware that these services provide temporary environments: anything you do will be deleted after a while, so make sure you save anything you care about.

* Open this repository in [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/MaximShovkun/twitter_analytics/master):
<a href="https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/MaximShovkun/twitter_analytics/master"><img src="https://matthiasbussonnier.com/posts/img/binder_logo_128x128.png" width="90" /></a>

  * _Note_: Most of the time, Binder starts up quickly and works great, but when handson-ml2 is updated, Binder creates a new environment from scratch, and this can take quite some time.

* Or open it in [Deepnote](https://beta.deepnote.com/launch?template=data-science&url=https%3A//github.com/MaximShovkun/twitter_analytics/blob/master/index.ipynb):
<a href="https://beta.deepnote.com/launch?template=data-science&url=https%3A//github.com/MaximShovkun/twitter_analytics/master/index.ipynb"><img src="https://www.deepnote.com/static/illustration.png" width="150" /></a>

* Or open it in [Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/github/MaximShovkun/twitter_analytics/blob/master/):
<a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/MaximShovkun/twitter_analytics/blob/master/"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/img/colab_favicon.ico" width="90" /></a>

  * _Note_: Colab environments only contain the notebooks you open, they do not clone the rest of the project, so you need to do it yourself by running `!git clone https://github.com/MaximShovkun/twitter_analytics` and `!mv twitter_analytics/* /content` to have access to other files in this project (such as datasets and images). Moreover, Colab does not come with the latest libraries, so you need to run `!python3 -m pip install -U -r requirements.txt` then restart the environment (but do not reset it!). If you open multiple notebooks from this project, you only need to do this once (as long as you do not reset the runtimes).

### Just want to quickly look at some notebooks, without executing any code?

Browse this repository using [jupyter.org's notebook viewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/MaximShovkun/twitter_analytics/blob/master/index.ipynb):
<a href="http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/MaximShovkun/twitter_analytics/blob/master/index.ipynb"><img src="https://jupyter.org/assets/nav_logo.svg" width="150" /></a>

_Note_: [github.com's notebook viewer](https://github.com/MaximShovkun/twitter_analytics/blob/master/index.ipynb) also works but it is slower and the math equations are not always displayed correctly.
